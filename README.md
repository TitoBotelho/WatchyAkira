Watchy is an open code and open hardware SmartWatch based on ESP32.

You can learn more of this Watch on this website:

The picture of Akira is from this repository:

I used Arduino to develop and upload the code, but you can use Platform IO extension for VS code.

This face shows only hour, date and day ao the week, it does not show battery level, number of steps and other funcions.

There are 2 fonts on the display, one for the hour and other for date and day of the week.
